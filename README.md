# PS5 Stock Bot

A Selenium based web scraper that determines what stores nearby have PlayStation 5 products available to purchase. The stock bot then notifies a given user with an automated email message informing the user of any available PlayStations available.

## Modules used:

- Selenium (For scraping the website)
- Flask (For running the script in the background)
- Smtplib (For automatically sending an email)
- Schedule (For scheduling what time of day to run)

This project utilizes [Replit](https://replit.com) and [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com) to host and run the code daily at a set time.

This bot scrapes [stocktrack.ca](https://stocktrack.ca)

\*This bot was meant to be a personal project and was not intended for commercial use.\*
